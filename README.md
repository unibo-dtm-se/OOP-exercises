# OOP Exercises in Python 

## Exercise 1
Create a class "Greeter" with a method "greet(...)" that prints a greeting for some name to be provided as an argument.

## Exercise 2
Create a "Car" class with fields "producer", "model", and "year". Include a method to display the details of the car as a string. Include methods to compute the equality among cars.

## Exercise 3
Write a Python program to create a class representing a Poligon. Include methods to calculate its area and perimeter.

## Exercise 4
Write a Python program to create a "Person" class. Include fields like "name", "country", and "date of birth". Implement a method to determine the person's "age".

## Exercise 5
Write a Python program to create a class representing a shopping cart. Include methods for adding and removing items, and calculating the total price.
Items may require their own modelling as a class.

## Exercise 6 
Write a Python program to create a class representing a stack data structure. Include methods for pushing and popping elements. (More details about stacks [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)))

## Exercise 7
Write a Python program to create a class representing a bank. Include methods for managing customer accounts and transactions.

## Exercise 8
Design a system for a library that manages different types of items available for borrowing. Each item in the library has some common attributes, such as a title, a creator (like an author or director), a publication year, and a unique identifier. All items should also have a way to display their details.

Within the library, there are different types of items (e.g., books and DVDs), each with its own unique characteristics. Some might have information about the number of pages, while others could include details like duration or content rating. These specific characteristics should be added while still maintaining the shared structure that all library items have in common.

In addition to storing and displaying information, the system should allow users to borrow and return items. Once borrowed, an item should be marked as unavailable, and when returned, it should become available again.
